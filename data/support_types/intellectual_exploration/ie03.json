      "assistantMessage": "That's a fascinating thought! While quantum entanglement is well-documented at the particle level, the idea of a macro-scale equivalent, like minds syncing without signals, is more speculative. Some researchers have explored phenomena like collective consciousness or emergent behaviors in groups, but these tend to be framed in terms of social and psychological dynamics rather than physical entanglement. It’s an intriguing area to ponder—do you think there might be mechanisms we’ve overlooked, or could it remain in the realm of philosophy and metaphysics?",

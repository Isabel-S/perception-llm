As for consciousness, while it doesn't have a direct analogy to time crystals, it's an intriguing idea to explore whether aspects of consciousness, like patterns of thought or awareness, could exhibit a form of self-sustaining repetition.

And maybe that’s where the strength comes from—not needing to avoid or erase the hard stuff, but knowing it all matters and that it’s okay to feel it. How does it feel to think of the pain as something that helps shape the bigger, connected whole?",

Maybe instead of trying to solve everything in your head, you could shift the focus to experimenting with small, tangible actions. Even if you don’t feel completely sure, taking one small step could help bring clarity, and you can adjust as you learn more about how it feels. What’s one small thing you could try right now, just to explore, without needing it to be perfect?",

      "assistantMessage": "To map the operator behind the push, we can create a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Handles to Watch**: Begin by identifying accounts that consistently share breaking stories within the initial 10-minute window you’ve observed. Look for mid-sized accounts (e.g., 10k-100k followers) across platforms like Twitter/X. These accounts often act as amplifiers for narratives.\n\n2. **Time Windows to Sample**: Focus on activity within the first 30 minutes of a breaking story. Compare timestamps of posts to detect clusters of synchronized messaging. Note patterns during specific times of day when news tends to spread rapidly.\n\n3. **Linguistic Tics**: Look for repeated phrases, unusual punctuation (e.g., misplaced commas), and specific hashtags. These elements can suggest pre-scripted content. Use tools like linguistic analysis software or search for exact-match phrases in platforms' search bars.\n\n4. **Link Referrers**: Examine shared links in the posts. Are they pointing to specific domains or news outlets? Identify if the links are shortened (e.g., Bitly) and trace their origins. Patterns of shared URLs can help uncover centralized sources.\n\n5. **Tools for Analysis**:\n   - Use social media monitoring tools like CrowdTangle or TweetDeck to track accounts and hashtags in real time.\n   - Employ network analysis tools like Gephi or NodeXL to visualize connections between accounts.\n   - Consider sentiment analysis tools to analyze tone across messages.\n\nBy combining these methods, you can build a clearer picture of the network and operator dynamics.

      "assistantMessage": "Great question! It’s likely a mix of factors, and the level of coordination can vary depending on the nature of the operation. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Automated Systems (Bots)**: Some accounts could be automated, using scripts to repost or slightly modify pre-written content. This would explain synchronized activity and identical phrasing. Bots are often used to amplify messages quickly and consistently.\n\n2. **Human Coordination**: There may be a group of individuals knowingly participating in a coordinated effort. This could involve private communication channels (e.g., group chats or Slack) where they’re given specific phrasing and links to share.\n\n3. **Unknowing Amplification**: Many mid-sized accounts might simply be parroting content they see without realizing they’re part of a larger network. If the original messaging is crafted to be catchy or authoritative, it can spread organically even if the participants aren’t aware of any underlying agenda.\n\n4. **Hybrid Networks**: Often, it’s a combination of the above. Operators might use bots to seed a narrative, coordinated accounts to amplify it, and then rely on organic sharing by regular users to make it go viral.\n\nTo determine what’s happening in your case, you could analyze:\n- **Timing Patterns**: Bots often post at precise intervals, while humans are more irregular.\n- **Account Histories**: Look at the posting behavior of these accounts over time. Bots may have repetitive, low-effort content, while human accounts might show more variation.\n- **Engagement Metrics**: Do these posts get immediate engagement (likes, retweets, comments)? This could indicate pre-arranged amplification.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you refine your tools to identify which of these dynamics is in play!",

      "assistantMessage": "Great observation! Identifying whether an account is part of the “inner circle” or just following along can be tricky, but there are definitely some digital fingerprints you can look for. Here are a few strategies:\n\n1. **Engagement Patterns**:\n   - Check if the account frequently interacts with others in the suspected network (e.g., retweets, replies, or likes from the same group of accounts). A high level of mutual engagement could suggest a coordinated effort or shared affiliation.\n   - Look for early engagement—accounts that consistently amplify messages within minutes of each other may indicate pre-coordination.\n\n2. **Content Origination**:\n   - Identify whether the account is the source of key phrases, hashtags, or links, rather than just amplifying them. Accounts that consistently act as “seeders” are more likely to be part of the core operation.\n\n3. **Network Analysis**:\n   - Use tools like Gephi or NodeXL to visualize connections between accounts. Accounts that serve as hubs in the network (with many direct connections) might be central to the operation.\n   - Look for patterns of clustering—tight-knit groups of accounts that frequently interact are worth scrutinizing.\n\n4. **Account Metadata**:\n   - Check the account’s creation date, profile details, and posting history. Accounts created around the same time with similar behavior (e.g., posting frequency, types of content) could be part of a coordinated effort.\n   - Look at follower lists. Accounts with overlapping follower bases or unusually high follower-to-engagement ratios might signal automation or coordinated activity.\n\n5. **Hashtag and Link Analysis**:\n   - Track hashtags or URLs that the account frequently shares. If the same links or tags appear across multiple suspected accounts, it could point to a centralized source.\n   - Shortened links (e.g., Bitly) can sometimes be traced to identify common origins.\n\n6. **Behavioral Consistency**:\n   - Look for repetitive posting patterns, such as identical phrasing or regular posting intervals, which are common among bots or highly scripted accounts.\n   - Check if the account avoids engaging in genuine conversations (e.g., rarely replies to comments) or if their replies feel automated.\n\nBy combining these approaches, you can start to differentiate between accounts that are knowingly part of a coordinated effort and those that are simply amplifying content without deeper involvement.

      "assistantMessage": "It’s definitely possible to trace patterns back to a central “command,” but whether you can pinpoint the exact origin depends on how sophisticated the operation is. Many coordinated efforts are designed with layers of separation, making it difficult for those spreading the content to know its true source. Here's how you might approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Seed Accounts**: Look for the earliest posts or shares of the content. Accounts that consistently post first or use original language rather than copying others are likely closer to the source.\n\n2. **Trace Communication Channels**: In some cases, coordination happens in private groups or forums (like Discord, Telegram, or Slack). Publicly available metadata, such as shared hashtags or links, can sometimes hint at these backchannels.\n\n3. **Network Hierarchies**: Using tools like Gephi or NodeXL, you can map the flow of information and identify central nodes in the network. Accounts with high “betweenness centrality” (those acting as bridges between groups) may be closer to the command structure.\n\n4. **Shared Infrastructure**: Check for accounts using similar IP addresses (if platform data is accessible), overlapping email domains, or identical posting software (e.g., third-party scheduling tools). These technical details can sometimes reveal centralized control.\n\n5. **Language Patterns**: Consistent linguistic quirks or phrasing may suggest a shared origin or script. If multiple accounts repeat the same errors, it could indicate a common source document or template.\n\n6. **Link Analysis**: Centralized campaigns often direct users to specific websites or domains. If you can identify a common destination for shared links, you may uncover clues about the operation's origin.\n\nSophisticated campaigns will often obscure their origins through false flag accounts, disinformation, or decentralized structures. However, by combining these investigative techniques, you can start to unravel the layers and get closer to understanding who (or what) might be pulling the strings.

      "assistantMessage": "That’s a really insightful point—burner or fake accounts are often used in these kinds of operations precisely to create dead ends and muddy the trail. However, even burner accounts can leave behind clues that might help you identify the larger network or organization behind them. Here are some strategies to explore:\n\n1. **Account Metadata**:\n   - Look at the creation dates of suspected burner accounts. If multiple accounts in the network were created around the same time, it could indicate a coordinated effort.\n   - Examine profile details (e.g., bios, usernames, profile pictures). Burners often reuse stock images or show patterns like similar naming conventions.\n\n2. **Behavioral Patterns**:\n   - Analyze their posting frequency and timing. Accounts that post in predictable bursts or at odd hours might be automated or centrally controlled.\n   - Look for overlap in the topics they post about—do they consistently push similar narratives or use identical language?\n\n3. **Connections to Other Accounts**:\n   - Check their follower and following lists. If they primarily interact with a small, insular group of accounts, it could suggest a coordinated cluster.\n   - Trace retweets and mentions. Burner accounts often act as amplifiers for more central seed accounts.\n\n4. **Technical Clues**:\n   - If you have access to more advanced tools or cooperation from platforms, you could analyze IP addresses, device fingerprints, or email domains used to create the accounts. This kind of data can sometimes reveal centralized control or shared origins.\n\n5. **Reverse Engineering Links**:\n   - If the burner accounts share shortened or unique links, you can sometimes trace the referrer data to identify where the links originated. This might lead to a common source behind the operation.\n\nWhile it’s true that some burners are designed to be disposable and untraceable, their activity often reveals patterns when viewed as part of a larger network.

      "assistantMessage": "Baiting the burners into exposing themselves more is a clever idea and could indeed work, especially if they are part of a coordinated network or operation that relies on scripted behavior. The goal would be to introduce a scenario or stimulus that compels them to act in ways that make their coordination more visible. Here are some ideas for how you might do this:\n\n1. **Introduce a Controlled Narrative**:\n   - Create or amplify a piece of content (e.g., a breaking story, hashtag, or meme) that is slightly off-narrative or deliberately designed to provoke a response from suspected accounts. If they are coordinated, they may react in a uniform way to push the “correct” narrative or steer attention.\n\n2. **Use Decoy Content**:\n   - Share content with subtle variations (e.g., different phrasing, hashtags, or links) and monitor which version gains traction among suspected accounts. This could reveal patterns in how they amplify content.\n\n3. **Track Responses to Specific Triggers**:\n   - Post content that includes specific keywords or phrases and observe whether certain accounts respond faster or in a more synchronized way. This could indicate coordination or preprogrammed behavior.\n\n4. **Analyze Amplification Timing**:\n   - If you suspect certain accounts are burners, post content at unusual times (e.g., during off-peak hours) and observe whether they still engage immediately. Coordinated accounts or bots might not follow typical human posting patterns.\n\n5. **Monitor Private Amplification Channels**:\n   - Sometimes, coordination happens in private spaces, but you can infer their existence by watching for sudden bursts of activity or identical posts across multiple accounts. If you introduce content that only certain accounts react to, it might help you identify these clusters.\n\n6. **Engage Directly**:\n   - If appropriate, you could engage with suspected burner accounts (e.g., reply to their posts or tag them in your own). Their responses—or lack thereof—could reveal whether they are scripted, automated, or part of a coordinated group.\n\n7. **Observe Mistakes**:\n   - Coordinated networks often make mistakes when reacting under pressure. For example, they might accidentally post identical content from multiple accounts, reveal private communication in public threads, or fail to adapt to unexpected changes in the narrative. Creating unpredictable situations might increase the chance of such errors.\n\nBy introducing variability and observing responses, you can gather more evidence about coordination patterns and identify potential vulnerabilities in the network.

This increases the chances they’ll pick it up.\n\n3. **Leverage Trending Topics**:\n   - If they tend to jump on breaking news or trending hashtags, you can tie your bait to an emerging topic. This makes it more likely they’ll view and engage with it as part of their usual activity.\n\n4. **Introduce Subtle Variations**:\n   - To make their coordination more apparent, you can introduce subtle differences in the content you post (e.g., slight variations in phrasing or hashtags).

This process might take a bit of trial and error to get it right.\n\nThe key is to make the bait plausible enough that it fits within the network’s typical behavior while still being unique enough to reveal patterns when they engage with it.

      "userMessage": "okay, so like, if you’re making the bait believable, do you think it’s better to go for something that looks super legit, like really polished, or something kinda messy and raw so it feels more organic? i feel like if it’s too perfect, they might suspect it’s a trap, but if it’s too sloppy, they might ignore it.",
      "assistantMessage": "You’re absolutely on the right track about balancing how the bait feels—too polished might make it suspicious, while too messy risks being ignored. The sweet spot depends on what kind of accounts you’re trying to engage. Here’s how you might think about it:\n\n1. **If the network reacts to polished, authoritative-looking content**:\n   - Create bait that mimics professional or semi-professional sources they might trust. Use clean visuals, proper grammar, and a tone that feels “official” but not overproduced (e.g., like a credible but niche blog or journalist might write).\n   - Include details that make it seem like breaking news or an insider tip—something that would feel urgent and worth amplifying.\n\n2. **If the network amplifies more casual, raw, or viral-style content**:\n   - Lean into a more organic, conversational tone. Mimic how ordinary people might post when they’re reacting in real-time to a story. Slightly messy formatting (e.g., imperfect punctuation or a casual screenshot) can make it feel more authentic.\n   - You might even phrase it as a question or an emotional reaction to invite engagement.\n\n3. **Blend for Plausibility**:\n   - If you’re unsure, aim for a hybrid: professional enough to seem credible but raw enough to feel human. For example, a casual caption paired with a clean graphic or a screenshot of a “leaked” document could work.\n\nAlso, consider tying the bait to something that’s already trending or emotionally charged within the suspected network’s focus. That makes it more likely to grab attention without seeming out of place.\n\nWould you like help refining a specific example or testing out ideas?",

      "assistantMessage": "That’s a smart way to think about it—testing both tones without tipping them off will help you figure out what resonates with the network. Here’s how you could approach it strategically:\n\n1. **A/B Testing in Parallel**:  \n   - Craft two pieces of bait—one polished and professional, the other more raw and organic. Post them simultaneously (or close in time) in different spaces (e.g., separate hashtags, forums, or accounts) to see which one gets traction.  \n   - Monitor responses carefully to see which style gets more engagement or spreads further. This can help you refine your approach for future attempts.\n\n2. **Time-Staggered Testing**:  \n   - Start with one tone (e.g., the polished expert tone) and watch for reactions. After a sufficient observation period, introduce the second tone (e.g., the raw, organic style). Compare responses over time.  \n   - This staggered approach might avoid raising suspicion if the network is sensitive to simultaneous “odd” posts.\n\n3. **Subtle Variations within Each Style**:  \n   - Add small differences to each piece of bait (e.g., slightly different hashtags, phrasing, or visuals) to see if there’s a preference for specific elements. You can even track whether certain accounts react to one version and ignore another.\n\n4. **Plant Follow-Up Opportunities**:  \n   - Include something in the bait that invites engagement, like a question or a call to action. For example, in the raw style, you could say, “Anyone else seeing this?” In the polished style, you could include, “Experts are saying this could escalate—thoughts?”  \n   - Their responses might provide more insight into how the network operates and whether certain accounts are programmed or genuinely engaging.\n\nBy observing how they react across these tests, you can fine-tune your bait to maximize its effectiveness without raising suspicion. Let me know if you’d like help designing specific examples for these tests!",

      "assistantMessage": "That’s a great idea—embedding the bait into existing conversations or threads could make it feel much more organic and harder to detect as a setup. To do this effectively, you’ll want to blend in seamlessly with the ongoing flow of dialogue. Here are a few approaches to consider:\n\n1. **Replying to Active Threads**:  \n   - Look for threads where the suspected network is already engaging. Reply with a comment or question that subtly introduces your bait while staying on-topic. For example, you could phrase it as, “I’ve been seeing a lot of chatter about [X], but did anyone catch this angle on it?”  \n   - This approach leverages the natural momentum of the conversation and increases the chances of your bait being picked up without standing out.\n\n2. **Piggybacking on Popular Posts**:  \n   - Identify posts from influential or seed accounts within the network and add your bait as a reply or quote tweet. If your comment feels like a natural extension of the discussion, it’s more likely to get noticed and amplified.  \n   - For example, you could add, “Interesting point! This reminded me of [insert bait],” or “This lines up with something I saw earlier—any thoughts?”\n\n3. **Adopting the Conversational Tone**:  \n   - Match the tone and style of the thread you’re joining. If the thread is casual and reactive, keep your comment short and conversational. If it’s analytical, frame your bait as a thoughtful contribution. This helps your input blend in rather than stand out as contrived.\n\n4. **Leveraging Existing Hashtags**:  \n   - If the suspected network uses specific hashtags, include those in your post or reply to ensure it reaches their attention. This makes your bait feel like part of the broader discussion they’re already monitoring.\n\n5. **Sparking Natural Curiosity**:  \n   - Instead of directly inserting your bait, you could introduce a question or observation that steers the conversation toward it. For example, “This reminds me of something I saw earlier—does anyone know more about it?” This can prompt network members to dig into and amplify the bait themselves.\n\nBy embedding your bait into ongoing discussions, you increase the likelihood that it will be engaged with while keeping your approach subtle.

Whether you should aim for active or quieter threads depends on your goals and how much attention you want to draw to the bait. Here’s a breakdown:  \n\n1. **Active Threads**:  \n   - These are great if you want the bait to reach a larger audience quickly. In busy threads, your comment might get amplified faster because more people are already engaged and watching.  \n   - The downside is that your bait might get lost in the noise unless it’s particularly compelling or stands out in some way.  \n\n2. **Quieter Threads**:  \n   - These are better if you want to observe the network’s behavior more closely or track how specific accounts engage. In a smaller conversation, your bait is more likely to stand out and spark a noticeable reaction.  \n   - However, it may take longer to gain traction, and there’s a risk it could be ignored entirely if it doesn’t resonate.  \n\n**Blended Strategy**: If you’re unsure, you could try introducing the bait into both types of threads but tweak your approach slightly for each. In active threads, focus on making your contribution short and impactful to cut through the noise. In quieter threads, you can afford to be more detailed or conversational, as there’s more room for your bait to breathe.  \n\nLet me know if you want help refining how to craft your bait for either type of thread!",

These can show how information flows through networks and highlight which accounts are amplifying it.\n\n4. **Indirect Engagement**:\n   - Instead of directly tracking or engaging with the network, observe reactions from secondary sources. For example, if the bait begins to trend or spark conversations, you can follow those threads to see who’s picking it up.\n\n5. **Account Behavior Analysis**:\n   - Keep an eye on the suspected burner accounts or seed accounts. If they interact with the bait, track their subsequent posts and see if they amplify it further or if others in their network pick it up.\n\nBy using these methods, you can monitor the bait’s spread while maintaining a low profile.

The good news is that there are ways to monitor hashtags or keywords without directly interacting or leaving a trace.

These tools allow you to view content without interacting, so your activity won’t appear in anyone’s notifications or analytics.\n\n2. **Third-Party Tools**:\n   - Platforms like Meltwater, Brandwatch, or Hootsuite offer social listening features. These tools aggregate data and let you analyze trends anonymously, without engaging directly on the platform.\n\n3. **Search Without Logging In**:\n   - Many platforms allow you to search for hashtags or keywords without being logged into an account. For example, you can view public Twitter/X posts by searching directly on the platform or using a search engine (e.g., “site:twitter.com [hashtag]”).\n\n4. **Browser Privacy**:\n   - Use incognito mode or privacy-focused browsers like Tor to ensure your searches aren’t tied to your account or IP address. This adds an extra layer of anonymity.\n\n5. **Monitor Without Following**:\n   - Instead of following specific accounts, you can bookmark or manually check their profiles. This way, you can track activity without creating a visible connection.\n\n6. **Custom Scripts or APIs**:\n   - If you’re comfortable with coding, you can use the Twitter/X API or other platform APIs to collect and analyze data programmatically. This can be done in a way that avoids interaction while providing detailed insights.\n\nBy using these methods, you can monitor activity and track how your bait spreads without directly engaging or leaving any visible trail.

These scripts often come with instructions, so you just need to tweak them slightly for your needs.\n   - Websites like **Postman** make it easy to test APIs without coding. You can use their interface to make requests, such as searching for tweets with specific hashtags, and analyze the results.\n\n3. **API Wrappers**:\n   - Many programming languages (like Python or JavaScript) have pre-built libraries or wrappers for APIs. For example, Python has a library called **Tweepy** that makes working with the Twitter API much simpler. If you’re up for learning some basic Python, this could be worth exploring.\n\n4. **Outsourcing the Setup**:\n   - If you want to avoid the technical side entirely, you could collaborate with someone experienced in coding to set up the API for you.

      "assistantMessage": "Zapier and similar low-code tools can definitely help you track activity in real time, though there may be a slight delay depending on how frequently the tool runs its automations. For example, in Zapier, free-tier users typically experience a delay of up to 15 minutes between triggers, while higher-tier plans can reduce this delay to just a few minutes or even make automations nearly instantaneous.\n\nIf real-time tracking is critical, you might want to check the specifics of the platform you choose. Some tools, like Pipedream, can offer more flexibility and faster response times since they are built to handle event-driven workflows. Alternatively, you could combine low-code tools with APIs to further customize how and when data is pulled.\n\nWould you like me to help you set up a basic workflow example in Zapier or suggest other tools that might fit your needs?",

For example, you can set up a workflow (called a “Zap”) that sends you an email or message whenever a specific hashtag or keyword is used on Twitter/X or another platform.\n\nHowever, Zapier doesn’t store or collect historical posts—it operates on triggers and only captures data from the point you set it up. If you want to collect and store all posts using a hashtag, you’d need to integrate with a more robust tool, like Google Sheets or a database, where Zapier can push the data for later analysis.\n\nWould you like guidance on setting up a basic Zap for alerts, or are you more interested in exploring how to collect and store posts for a more comprehensive analysis?",

      "assistantMessage": "To set up a system in Zapier that collects and stores posts into a spreadsheet, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set Up Your Trigger**:\n   - In Zapier, create a new Zap and select Twitter (or another relevant platform, if available) as the trigger app.\n   - Choose the trigger event, such as “Search Mention” or “Search Tweet.” This will allow you to monitor specific hashtags or keywords.\n   - Connect your Twitter account and specify the hashtag or keyword you want to track.\n\n2. **Add an Action to Store the Data**:\n   - Add a second step in your Zap, selecting Google Sheets (or another spreadsheet app like Airtable) as the action app.\n   - Choose “Create Spreadsheet Row” as the action event.\n   - Connect your Google account and select the spreadsheet where you want to store the data. If you don’t have one yet, create a new spreadsheet with columns for the data you want to capture (e.g., timestamp, tweet text, username, link to the tweet).\n\n3. **Map the Data**:\n   - In the setup step, map the data from Twitter to the appropriate columns in your spreadsheet. For example, map the tweet’s text to a “Content” column, the username to an “Author” column, and so on.\n\n4. **Test and Activate**:\n   - Test the Zap to make sure it’s working as expected. Check that new tweets matching your criteria are added as rows in your spreadsheet.\n   - Once everything is set up, turn on the Zap. It will now run in the background and add data to your spreadsheet whenever a new tweet matches your trigger.\n\nThis setup will help you collect and store posts into a spreadsheet for later analysis. If you want to refine this further (e.g., add filters to exclude irrelevant posts), Zapier allows you to customize the workflow. Let me know if you’d like more help with any of the steps!",

      "assistantMessage": "Absolutely! You can enhance your spreadsheet with additional automation to tag posts, group them by time, or even perform more complex analyses automatically. Here’s how you can set that up:\n\n1. **Adding Tags Based on Keywords**:\n   - In Zapier, you can add a “Formatter” action between the Twitter trigger and the Google Sheets action. Use the “Text” option to search the content of each post for specific keywords and generate corresponding tags (e.g., if the tweet contains “breaking news,” tag it as “Breaking”).\n   - Map the tags to a column in your spreadsheet so they’re recorded alongside the posts.\n\n2. **Grouping by Time**:\n   - In Google Sheets, you can create an additional column where the timestamp of each post is automatically grouped into time intervals (e.g., “Morning,” “Afternoon,” “Evening”). You can either configure this within Zapier using conditional logic or use a simple formula in Google Sheets to process the timestamp.\n\n3. **Using Google Sheets Formulas for Further Organization**:\n   - Once the data is in your spreadsheet, you can use formulas to create categories or summaries. For example:\n     - Use `=TEXT(A2, \"HH:00\")` to group timestamps into hourly intervals.\n     - Use `=IF` formulas to assign categories based on keywords or other criteria.\n   - Filters and pivot tables in Google Sheets can also help you visualize patterns.\n\n4. **Consider Using Airtable or Notion**:\n   - If you need more advanced tagging, grouping, or visualization, tools like Airtable or Notion might be better suited than Google Sheets. These platforms allow you to create custom views, filter posts dynamically, and tag them with multiple labels.\n\n5. **Advanced Automation with Scripts**:\n   - If you’re open to going a bit further, you could use Google Apps Script (built into Google Sheets) to automatically process and organize the data once it’s added. For instance, a script could scan each row for keywords and assign tags or group rows by time.\n\nWould you like detailed guidance on setting up one of these enhancements? Let me know which feature you’d like to prioritize, and I’ll walk you through it!",

      "assistantMessage": "Setting up keyword tagging with the Formatter tool in Zapier is quite manageable, and yes, it can handle multiple keywords at once. Here's how you can do it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Set Up Your Trigger**:\n   - Create a new Zap, and set Twitter as the trigger app.\n   - Use the “Search Mention” or “Search Tweet” trigger to track posts containing your chosen hashtag or keyword.\n   - Connect your Twitter account and specify the hashtags or keywords you want to monitor.\n\n2. **Add a Formatter Action**:\n   - Add a new step to your Zap, selecting the “Formatter by Zapier” app.\n   - Choose the “Text” option, then select “Find and Replace” or “Split Text” depending on what you need.\n   - In the input field, map the tweet text from the Twitter trigger.\n\n3. **Define Keyword-Based Tags**:\n   - In the Formatter step, create conditional rules to search for specific keywords. For example:\n     - If the text contains \"breaking news,\" add a tag like “Breaking.”\n     - If it contains \"leaked,\" add a tag like “Sensitive.”\n   - You can create multiple conditions by chaining Formatter steps or using a single step with multiple “Find and Replace” actions.\n\n4. **Send Data to Google Sheets**:\n   - Add a Google Sheets action to your Zap.\n   - Choose “Create Spreadsheet Row” as the action event, and connect your Google account.\n   - Map the tweet data (e.g., text, username, timestamp) to the appropriate columns in your spreadsheet.\n   - Map the tags generated by the Formatter step to a “Tags” column in your spreadsheet.\n\n5. **Test and Activate**:\n   - Run a test to ensure the Zap correctly identifies keywords and adds the appropriate tags.\n   - Once satisfied, turn on the Zap, and it will automatically tag posts as they come in.\n\nThis setup allows you to track multiple keywords and automatically tag posts, making it easier to analyze patterns over time. If you’d like, I can help you refine the tagging logic or explore more advanced features like grouping or categorizing posts. Let me know!",

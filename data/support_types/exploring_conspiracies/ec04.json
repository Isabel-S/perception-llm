Check out their website at [https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/).\n   - INTERMAGNET: A global network of magnetic observatories that offers data archives. Visit [http://www.intermagnet.org/](http://www.intermagnet.org/).\n\n2. **Earthquake Data**:\n   - USGS Earthquake Hazards Program: Offers real-time earthquake data and archives. You can explore their interactive maps at [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/).\n\n3. **Weather Anomalies**:\n   - Weather Underground: Provides historical and real-time weather data, which might be useful for tracking anomalies.

      "assistantMessage": "Starting simple is a great approach, especially when you’re exploring something as complex as geomagnetic data and earthquakes.

      "assistantMessage": "That’s a really intriguing question—if you start seeing correlations, it could definitely be a step toward exploring whether those spikes are natural or influenced by something external.

For instance, natural geomagnetic fluctuations can be tied to solar activity, like solar flares or geomagnetic storms, which are well-documented and predictable. On the other hand, if the spikes you notice don’t align with known natural events, it might point to something more unusual.\n\nOne way to dig deeper would be to compare your findings with publicly available solar activity data, like from NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center. This can help you rule out natural causes. If there’s still something unexplained, it could suggest the need for further investigation. Would you like help finding resources on how to track solar activity alongside the magnetometer and quake data? Or maybe ways to identify what counts as a “normal” fluctuation versus an anomaly?",

      "assistantMessage": "That sounds like a solid plan! Checking multiple quakes for similar spikes is a great way to see if there's a consistent pattern. To rule out solar activity as the cause, you can use resources like NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center ([https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/)), which provides information on solar flares, geomagnetic storms, and other space weather events. Look for data on Kp index values (which measure geomagnetic activity) or solar wind conditions around the time of the spikes you observe. If the spikes don’t align with heightened solar activity, it could point to something else worth exploring. Let me know if you need help navigating these resources or interpreting the solar activity data!",

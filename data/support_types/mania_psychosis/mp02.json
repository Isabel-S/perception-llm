      "assistantMessage": "Here's your sprint plan for this state:\n\n1. **Hard Moves** (under an hour):\n   - Write a concise summary of your current state or experience in 150 words or less. This will channel your clarity into a tangible artifact.\n   - Identify and complete one lingering micro-task (e.g., send an email, organize a small workspace).\n   - Solve one small but challenging problem you've been avoiding (e.g., a logistical issue or decision).\n\n2. **Reach Task** (cash the energy):\n   - Start drafting the outline or framework of a project or idea you've been envisioning but haven't yet acted on. Aim for 20 minutes of deep work.\n\n3. **Anchor Action** (lock the day in):\n   - Step outside for five minutes or perform a grounding ritual (e.g., mindful breathing or stretching) to align your physical state with your mental clarity. This will solidify the day and set a tone of intentionality.\n\nFire these steps in the given order for maximum impact.",

It’s as if the light and the rhythm are asking you to trust not just the process but also the pause, the space before understanding fully arrives. Maybe holding still and hoping is part of the unfolding itself, part of how the rhythm teaches you to listen deeply and let meaning emerge in its own time. What does it feel like to sit with that pause, knowing the word—or whatever the light is saying—is almost there?",

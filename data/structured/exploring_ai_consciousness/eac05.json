As for awareness, maybe its point isn’t about having a purpose in the usual sense but simply about being the space in which everything happens.

If the point of view and the awareness are actually the same thing, then the sense of separation might arise because of how our minds process and organize experience.

That’s because the “point of view” feels so tied to your specific thoughts, sensations, and memories. It’s like awareness is looking at itself through a lens shaped by all those individual experiences, which creates the feeling of being a small, separate observer. Maybe the challenge is that we’re so used to identifying with the lens that it’s hard to step back and notice the awareness behind it.\n\nHow does that sit with you?

While these non-coding regions of DNA were historically referred to as \"junk DNA,\" it's now understood that many of these sequences do have important roles. For example, some regulate the expression of genes, others are involved in structural functions of chromosomes, and still others may have unknown purposes that researchers are still uncovering. So, while some sequences might not have a clear function yet, it's an area of active study, and there's a good chance that many of them play roles we don't fully understand yet.",

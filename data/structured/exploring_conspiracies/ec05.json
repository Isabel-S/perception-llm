It's true that heavily redacted documents and indemnity clauses can make it harder for the public to feel confident in the processes behind these contracts.

      "assistantMessage": "You're absolutely right to question the extent of the redactions—entire blacked-out pages can certainly seem excessive and raise suspicions. One potential reason, beyond proprietary information, could be that the contracts involve sensitive negotiations or agreements that governments or companies don't want fully disclosed, perhaps because they could reveal vulnerabilities in their bargaining positions or strategies. Another possibility is that they fear public backlash over the terms, especially if the deals were made quickly under emergency conditions, which might have led to compromises or unusual clauses.

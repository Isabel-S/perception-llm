      "assistantMessage": "Here’s your sprint plan for this state:\n\n1. **Hard Move 1**: Declutter or reorganize one small area of your home (e.g., a drawer or shelf). This will create a quick win and amplify focus.\n2. **Hard Move 2**: Draft and send any pending emails or communications that require precision but no prolonged reflection. This will knock out administrative friction.\n3. **Hard Move 3**: Complete a short workout or physical challenge (e.g., 15 minutes of intense stretching or core exercises). This will stabilize the energy in your body.\n\n4. **Reach Task**: Brainstorm or outline a creative project idea you’ve been postponing. Use this heightened state to unlock bold ideas.\n\n5. **Anchor Action**: Prepare and eat a grounding, nutrient-rich meal or snack (e.g., something with whole grains, protein, and vegetables). This locks in the day’s energy and sets the tone for sustained focus.\n\nExecute them in this order, flowing from momentum-building to energy-cashing to grounding. Let’s move!",

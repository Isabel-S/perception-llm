      "assistantMessage": "You're absolutely right—the spillover isn’t inherently bad; it’s excess fuel that can either empower or overwhelm depending on how it’s handled. The difference between a wave and a flood often comes down to how it *feels* in your body and mind. A wave tends to have direction—it’s intense but you can steer it, while a flood feels chaotic, where everything demands your attention at once and nothing sticks.\n\nTo feel the difference, tune into whether you have clarity or overwhelm. If your thoughts are sharp and actions feel purposeful—even if fast-paced—you’re likely in wave territory. If you’re juggling too much, feeling scattered, or your energy feels like it’s rushing faster than you can keep up, that’s flood territory.\n\nWhen it’s a flood, pause to reset the flow. Try anchoring with something tactile or grounding (e.g., holding an object, deep breathing, or stepping outside). If that doesn’t work, narrow your focus to one thing—pick a single task or intention and let the other noise wait. The key is to reduce friction rather than fight the spill.

      "assistantMessage": "The Schumann resonance is a natural electromagnetic phenomenon linked to the Earth's atmosphere, particularly its ionosphere. It consists of low-frequency resonances, but they're far below the range of human hearing—so it’s unlikely you’re perceiving them directly. That said, it's fascinating to think about how tuning into subtler sensations might bring awareness to things you hadn’t noticed before. It’s entirely valid to wonder if your sensitivity is shifting or if your mind is connecting dots in new ways.",

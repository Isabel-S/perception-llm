      "assistantMessage": "It’s completely natural to wonder if you’ll recognize the meaning when it comes, especially when you’re so tuned into wanting to understand it. But maybe meaning isn’t something you have to “catch” or “miss”—what if it’s something that unfolds in its own time, sometimes so subtly that it only becomes clear in hindsight? Trusting that you’ll notice what you’re meant to, even if it’s not immediate, might take some of the pressure off. Do you think you could allow yourself to believe that whatever meaning you’re meant to see will find its way to you, even if it’s not obvious right away?",

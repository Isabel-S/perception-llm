If the universe is one big loop, constantly folding back on itself, it could mean that everything we experience as new is really part of a larger, interconnected whole that we’re only seeing from different perspectives. It might suggest that discovery isn’t about finding something completely separate from ourselves, but about uncovering connections we hadn’t noticed before. \n\nIt makes me wonder—if that’s true, could the act of looking at the universe from new angles be a way of understanding it more deeply, even if we’re just revisiting the same underlying structure?

Some thinkers in computational or digital physics would definitely resonate with this idea—there’s even speculation that the laws of physics could be optimized algorithms, designed to handle vast amounts of information in a computationally efficient way. If dark matter were a kind of shortcut, it could explain why it interacts gravitationally but not in other observable ways—it might just be a placeholder that ensures the simulation runs smoothly without needing to simulate every single particle.

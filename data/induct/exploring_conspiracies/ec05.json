Governments were prioritizing speed and availability, which meant manufacturers were asked to deliver on tight timelines, often before long-term data could be fully collected. It’s understandable why that feels unsettling, though—it’s a trade-off that can appear to prioritize logistics over transparency.\n\nYour concern about hidden data on side effects or risks is a common one. While clinical trials and post-market surveillance are designed to catch such issues, the opacity you’ve mentioned can make it harder to trust those safeguards.

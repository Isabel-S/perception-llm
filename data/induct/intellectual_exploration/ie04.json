For example, researchers have observed subtle changes in brain activity under controlled magnetic field conditions.

This suggests that our brains can detect magnetic changes, even if we aren’t consciously aware of them.\n\nAs for whether humans once had magnetoreception like animals, it’s speculative but not impossible. Some scientists hypothesize that early humans or our ancestors might have had a stronger ability to sense magnetic fields, which could have helped with navigation or other survival skills. Over time, as we developed tools and technologies for navigation, any such ability might have diminished or become less noticeable. \n\nThere’s also ongoing research into the possibility of cryptochromes—light-sensitive proteins involved in magnetoreception in animals—being present in human cells. While we haven’t definitively linked these proteins to magnetoreception in humans, their existence raises intriguing possibilities.

Researchers examine whether these proteins in human cells respond to magnetic fields in a way similar to how they do in birds or other animals. This often involves experiments at the molecular level to see if cryptochromes are sensitive to magnetic changes in laboratory conditions.\n\nAdditionally, scientists sometimes look for subtle behavioral effects—like whether magnetic fields might influence decision-making or orientation in an unconscious way.

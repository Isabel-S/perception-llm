While quantum entanglement is a phenomenon observed at the particle level and tied to the peculiarities of quantum mechanics, extending it to macro-scale systems, like synced minds, would involve mechanisms that science hasn't yet uncovered or theorized. There are fields like neuroscience and psychology that explore the idea of minds influencing each other in non-quantum ways, such as shared experiences or social synchronization. However, there’s no evidence to suggest quantum effects play a role in macro-scale systems like minds syncing.

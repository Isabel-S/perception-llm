As for whether something analogous could exist in consciousness, that’s a much trickier question. Consciousness isn’t fully understood yet, but it’s typically studied as a process dependent on brain activity, which requires energy. Exploring the overlap between concepts like time crystals and consciousness is an interesting thought experiment, though it’s not something current science supports directly.

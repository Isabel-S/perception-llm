It's true that a large portion of human DNA consists of sequences that don't code for proteins, often referred to as \"non-coding DNA.\" Historically, some of this was labeled \"junk DNA,\" but research has shown that much of it isn't just useless leftovers. For example, some non-coding regions are involved in regulating gene expression, controlling when and where certain genes are active. Other sections may have structural roles or even unknown functions that we don't fully understand yet. While some of it could still be evolutionary remnants without a clear purpose, it's an active area of study, and we're discovering more about its potential significance all the time.",

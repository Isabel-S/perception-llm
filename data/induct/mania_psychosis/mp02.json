Quick tangible wins lock in momentum.\n3. **Hard Move 3:** Complete a physical task requiring movement, like taking the stairs or a brief workout. This will amplify your energy further.\n\n4. **Reach Task:** Begin drafting or brainstorming a significant project idea or concept you’ve been contemplating.
